## Maven build process

This project is Maven compatible. In order to build an APK package using Maven, the following items need to be present:

* Maven 3.1
* Android SDK 19
* The ANDROID_HOME environment variable needs to be set and point to the root of the SDK installation directory.

Build steps:

* (first time setup only) `mvn install:install-file -Dfile=%ANDROID_HOME%\platforms\android-19\android.jar -DgroupId=com.google.android -DartifactId=android -Dversion=4.4.2 -Dpackaging=jar -DgeneratePom=true`
* `mvn package`

The above steps will create an APK artifact in the `target` directory.
